	•	Step 1: install python pip (https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/)
	•	Step 2: Install core ml tools for python in python 2.7 virtual environment
	•	Step 3: Download the desired caffe model and unzip it.
	•	Step 4: Open the unzipped folder in the terminal and create a file called convert-script.py (refer to the same file in the folder structure)
	•	Step 5: save and exit
	•	Step 6: Run the python convert-script.py command in the terminal to create the core ml file
	•	Step 7: Drag and drop the core ml file into your project 
	•	Step 8: Refer the project for the implementation 

Note: We have used a caffe model called Oxford 102 caffe model in this application. Which is trained on classifying flowers. Due to the large size I have ignored the flow classifier model.
